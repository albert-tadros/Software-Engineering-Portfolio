# [Project 1: LOOK UP | Social Interaction Mobile App](https://github.com/tpandos/lookup)

***Our mobile application promotes and facilitates connection between people that are in near proximity. Consider someone who has a great idea but needs help from someone with a particular skill set. What if this person can find exactly who they are looking for at the Cafe ÃÅ they always visit? Lookup provide an interface that can connect people more locally, allowing them to find the people that fit the criteria of their search within a limited distance relative to their location.
We want the user to have access to other individual who are at walking distance from them, who can spare a few minutes to meet in person and establish the beginning of a real interpersonal relationship.
Closing the distance gap can promote not only a more reliable interaction but also a literary closer one. Our mobile application LOOK UP is a social media app that helps promote more face-to-face interaction.***
